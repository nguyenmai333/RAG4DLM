Introduction
The annual Science and Technology Conference of the Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT), Vietnam National University - Ho Chi Minh City (VNU-HCM) is organized every two years. The conference consists of one plenary session and a series of specialized sessions organized by faculties and research institutes of the university throughout the year to share the latest research findings of scientists within and outside the university. In addition, the plenary session aims to exchange policies and directions of the central government on science and technology to serve socio-economic development.
In 2023, the plenary session of the 18th Science and Technology Conference is held with the theme "
Incentives for Innovation and Commercialization of Research & Development
," focusing on two out of the nine objectives of the science and technology sector in 2023: promoting the spin-off model of startup enterprises and enhancing the development of the market, businesses, and scientific and technological services, as well as promoting the commercialization of research results and developing intermediary organizations in the market. During the plenary session, delegates from both domestic and international entities will exchange and share experiences and innovative ideas in research and provide motivation for technology transfer and commercialization of research results.
The plenary session consists of 5 keynote speeches from HCMUT and partners on the current situation and experiences in commercializing research results. Additionally, there is a panel discussion among leaders of Ministries, Provinces/Cities of Vietnam, some Southeast Asian countries, businesses, and university representatives focusing on policy orientations, management roles, policies to promote innovative research, methods to drive technology transfer and commercialization and expedite the integration of research results generated from state budget into production and business, and the model of commercializing research outcomes.
The university's faculties and research institutes will organize 77 specialized sessions (52 international sessions and 25 domestic) from June 2023 to November 2023. Additionally, 50-100 exhibition booths will provide space for universities and companies to showcase their technological achievements. This event will also allow various entities to seek common ground and promote collaborative technology transfer.
The 18th Scientific Conference will be hosted by HCMUT on October 20th, 2023.
